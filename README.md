Drovp is a cross-platform desktop application that provides a convenient UI for any drag &amp; drop operations, which are facilitated by easy to create, publish, install, configure, and use plugins.

Plugins are simple [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) modules published to npm registry. To find out more, visit the [website](https://drovp.app), or read the [documentation](https://drovp.app/docs).

This repository is for tracking Drovp & Drovp API related issues, development, and discussions. It should eventually contain the app's source code once I'm happy with it.

If you're looking for plugins' source codes, they are all published under the [Drovp org](https://github.com/drovp).
